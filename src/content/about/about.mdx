My key responsibilities start with taking a part in project design, gathering and managing requirements, project development and maintenance as well as implementing new features.

I work with SCSS, HTML, JavaScript and PHP using WordPress as CMS solution o a daily basis. I really enjoy working with design systems and create accessible websites and well optimized.
